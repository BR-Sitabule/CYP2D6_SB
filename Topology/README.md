# Topology Generation
This folder contains the scripts used to generate topology files for the wildtype CYP2D6 enzyme (same procedure was employed for the mutant enzymes),  the input files required for the process, which includes the parameters of the heme group, and the proximal cysteine residue and the minimisation scripts which were used to minimise the system.
