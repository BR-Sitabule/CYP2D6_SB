# Topology Generation
This folder contains the scripts used to generate topology files for the CYP2D6 enzymes (wildtype and assessed variants), the minimisation scripts, which were used to minimise the system, and the input files required for the process which include the parameters of the heme group and the proximal cysteine residue.
